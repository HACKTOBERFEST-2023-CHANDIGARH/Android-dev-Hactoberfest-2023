# Dictionary App Project

## Overview

This README.md file provides a brief overview of the Dictionary App project. The goal of this project is to create a dictionary application that allows users to search for word definitions, store recent searches in a database, and fetch additional information about the search word using APIs. Developers are encouraged to maintain a professional approach while developing the app.

## Project Description

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a functional dictionary application with a user-friendly interface. The app should allow users to search for word definitions, display search history, and fetch extra information about the searched word using APIs.

### Guidelines

- **User Interface (UI):** 
  - The UI should provide an intuitive interface for searching word definitions.
  - Display definitions, pronunciations, and example sentences for the searched word.
  - Implement a section to show recent searches stored in a database.

- **Functionality:**
  - The dictionary app should allow users to search for word definitions.
  - Display definitions and relevant information for the searched word.
  - Implement database functionality to store and retrieve recent search history.
  - Fetch additional word-related data (e.g., synonyms, antonyms) using APIs.

- **Database and API Integration:**
  - Utilize a database (e.g., SQLite) to store recent search history.
  - Integrate APIs (e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary API) to fetch additional word information.

- **Professionalism:**
  - Maintain a professional coding style and adhere to best practices in software development.
  - Write clean and well-documented code.
  - Ensure that the application is user-friendly, responsive, and free from bugs or errors.

This project offers an opportunity to create a dictionary application that not only provides word definitions but also enhances the user experience by storing recent searches and fetching additional word-related data from external APIs.
